Hello there,
Everyone is welcome to participate in Hacktoberfest 2022.
You do not need to be a developer or a computer science student. Whether you’re an artist, a writer, or a translator, anyone can contribute back to open-source projects in one way or the other.

****There a few more conditions that could affect your participation, those include:

1. More than two pull requests labeled as “spam” will disqualify you for this Hacktoberfest and future DigitalOcean events.

2. Any pull requests labeled as “Invalid” (by the maintainer) will be discarded from your total goal.

3. Any pull request sent to repositories that do not align with Hacktoberfest’s values will not be counted against your total. At the moment, there is no official list that notifies you of any such repositories. If unsure, ask a question on the official Hacktoberfest Discord server.

4. Please avoid sending pull requests that are only slightly beneficial or are there just for the sake of introducing a minor change. Examples include “Fixed whitespaces“, “Fix typos“, “Reformat code using spaces instead of tabs“, and “Increment from 0 to i instead of decrementing i to 0“.

5. DSA code is not acceptable in this Repository, so make sure not to try  to do any invalid pull request.
